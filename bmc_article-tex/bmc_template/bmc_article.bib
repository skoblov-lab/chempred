@article{Fukuda1998,
	abstract = {To solve the mystery of the life phenomenon, we must clarify when genes are ex-pressed and how their products interact with each other. But since the amount of continuously updated knowledge on these interactions is massive and is only avail-able in the form of published articles, an intelligent information extraction (IE) system is needed. To extract these information directly from articles, the system must rstly identify the material names. However, medical and biological docu-ments often include proper nouns newly made by the authors, and conventional methods based on domain specic dictionaries cannot detect such unknown words or coinages. In this study, we propose a new method of extracting material names, PROPER, using surface clue on character strings. It extracts material names in the sentence with 94.70{\%} precision and 98.84{\%} recall, regardless of whether it is already known or newly dened. 1 Introduction Genome projects are now determining whole DNA sequences and genes of various species. The next target is to analyze the function of each gene. To understand the role of each gene, we must clarify when it is expressed and how its product interacts with other materials. Typical interaction includes protein-nucleotide and protein-protein bindings and many researchers are submitting articles on such kind of interactions. The quality and amount of continuously updated knowledge has become powerful enough to grapple with the mystery of life phenomenon. However, reading every article in the world requires too much time and labor. Therefore, we need an intelligent information extracting system to save time. To extract information on interactions directly from each article, the sys-tem must rstly identify material names, e.g. gene names and protein names. Identifying technical terms from quantities of unrestricted text is a challeng-ing task for natural language processing, especially in medical and biological papers. One will encounter the following diculties: unknown word process-ing, long compound word recognition, and requirement of robustness against ambiguous expressions that are used only among the area experts. As far as we know, there is no technical term extracting system that overcome these problems at once.},

Overall performance is discussed against five applications. The cTAKES annotations are the foundation for methods and modules for higher-level semantic processing of clinical free-text.},

	abstract = {EDGAR (Extraction of Drugs, Genes and Relations) is a natural language processing system that extracts information about drugs and genes relevant to cancer from the biomedical literature. This automatically extracted information has remarkable potential to facilitate computational analysis in the molecular biology of cancer, and the technology is straightforwardly generalizable to many areas of biomedicine. This paper reports on the mechanisms for automatically generating such assertions and on a simple application, conceptual clustering of documents. The system uses a stochastic part of speech tagger, generates an underspecified syntactic parse and then uses semantic and pragmatic information to construct its assertions. The system builds on two important existing resources: the MEDLINE database of biomedical citations and abstracts and the Unified Medical Language System, which provides syntactic and semantic information about the terms found in biomedical abstracts.},

The dictionary-based bio-entity extraction is the first generation of Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques.METHODS:This paper presents a hybrid dictionary-based bio-entity extraction technique. The approach expands the bio-entity dictionary by combining different data sources and improves the recall rate through the shortest path edit distance algorithm. In addition, the proposed technique adopts text mining techniques in the merging stage of similar entities such as Part of Speech (POS) expansion, stemming, and the exploitation of the contextual cues to further improve the performance.RESULTS:The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves the best or at least equivalent performance among compared techniques, GENIA, MESH, UMLS, and combinations of these three resources in F-measure.CONCLUSIONS:The results imply that the performance of dictionary-based extraction techniques is largely influenced by information resources used to build the dictionary. In addition, the edit distance algorithm shows steady performance with three different dictionaries in precision whereas the context-only technique achieves a high-end performance with three difference dictionaries in recall.},

	abstract = {As a fundamental step in biomedical information extraction tasks, biomedical named entity recognition remains challenging. In recent years, the neural network has been applied on the entity recognition to avoid the complex hand-designed features, which are derived from various linguistic analyses. However, performance of the conventional neural network systems is always limited to exploiting long range dependencies in sentences. In this paper, we mainly adopt the bidirectional recurrent neural network with LSTM unit to identify biomedical entities, in which the twin word embeddings and sentence vector are added to rich input information. Therefore, the complex feature extraction can be skipped. In the testing phase, Viterbi algorithm is also used to filter the illogical label sequences. The experimental results conducted on the BioCreative II GM corpus show that our system can achieve an F-score of 88.61Â {\{}{\%}{\}}, which outperforms CRF models using the complex hand-designed features and is 6.74Â {\{}{\%}{\}} higher than RNNs.},

@article{Crichton2017,
	abstract = {Background: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key task in biomedical text mining. Accurate NER systems require task-specific, manually-annotated datasets, which are expensive to develop and thus limited in size. Since such datasets contain related but different information, an interesting question is whether it might be possible to use them together to improve NER performance. To investigate this, we develop supervised, multi-task, convolutional neural network models and apply them to a large number of varied existing biomedical named entity datasets. Additionally, we investigated the effect of dataset size on performance in both single-and multi-task settings. Results: We present a single-task model for NER, a Multi-output multi-task model and a Dependent multi-task model. We apply the three models to 15 biomedical datasets containing multiple named entities including Anatomy, Chemical, Disease, Gene/Protein and Species. Each dataset represent a task. The results from the single-task model and the multi-task models are then compared for evidence of benefits from Multi-task Learning. With the Multi-output multi-task model we observed an average F-score improvement of 0.8{\%} when compared to the single-task model from an average baseline of 78.4{\%}. Although there was a significant drop in performance on one dataset, performance improves significantly for five datasets by up to 6.3{\%}. For the Dependent multi-task model we observed an average improvement of 0.4{\%} when compared to the single-task model. There were no significant drops in performance on any dataset, and performance improves significantly for six datasets by up to 1.1{\%}. The dataset size experiments found that as dataset size decreased, the multi-output model's performance increased compared to the single-task model's. Using 50, 25 and 10{\%} of the training data resulted in an average drop of approximately 3.4, 8 and 16.7{\%} respectively for the single-task model but approximately 0.2, 3.0 and 9.8{\%} for the multi-task model. Conclusions: Our results show that, on average, the multi-task models produced better NER results than the single-task models trained on a single NER dataset. We also found that Multi-task Learning is beneficial for small datasets. Across the various settings the improvements are significant, demonstrating the benefit of Multi-task Learning for this task.},
