# sciNER
Character-level RNN for named entity recognition in plain text.

This is a special ChemPred publication branch of the sciNER package. ChemPred
is a deep CNN-RNN architecture for chemical NER trained on the CHEMDNER corpus
(publication pending). Jupyter notebook `chempred-example.ipynb` will guide
you through the steps needed to train and validate the model. You an also find
trained weights for the model in `./models/chempred-model-weights.hdf5`.
